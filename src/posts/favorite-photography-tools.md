# My Photography Setup

After years of experimenting with different equipment and software, I've settled on a workflow that works well for me. Here's a look at my current photography setup.

## Camera Equipment

My main camera gear includes:

- **Sony A7IV** - My primary camera body
- **24-70mm f/2.8** - The lens that stays on my camera 80% of the time
- **85mm f/1.4** - My go-to portrait lens
- **16-35mm f/4** - For landscapes and architecture

I've found that having a small, focused kit forces me to be more creative with what I have rather than constantly switching equipment.

## Post-Processing Software

For editing, I typically use:

1. **Adobe Lightroom Classic** - For organizing and initial adjustments
2. **Photoshop** - For more detailed edits
3. **Capture One** - Sometimes used for tethered shooting

## Accessories That Make a Difference

Some less obvious tools that have improved my photography:

- A good tripod (mine is a carbon fiber Gitzo)
- ND filters for long exposures
- A color checker passport for color accuracy
- A small portable LED light for fill

## Conclusion

The best gear is whatever helps you create images you're happy with. These tools work for me, but photography is about vision more than equipment.
