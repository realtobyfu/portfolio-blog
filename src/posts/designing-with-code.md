# The Intersection of Design and Code

When we think about design, we often imagine visual layouts, color palettes, and typography. But in the modern world, design is increasingly tied to code.

## Why Designers Should Learn to Code

Learning to code helps designers:

1. **Understand limitations**: Knowing what's possible in code helps create more practical designs
2. **Communicate better**: Speaking the language of developers improves collaboration
3. **Create interactive prototypes**: Moving beyond static mockups to functional prototypes

## Why Developers Should Learn Design

Similarly, developers benefit from understanding design:

- User experience considerations improve the products they build
- Design systems help create consistent, maintainable code
- Visual hierarchy concepts translate well to code organization

## Tools That Bridge the Gap

Several modern tools help bridge the gap between design and development:

- Figma's code export features
- CSS frameworks like Tailwind
- Component-based architecture in React and other frameworks

By bringing design and code closer together, we create better products and more efficient workflows.
